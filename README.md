# telegram session + chrome passwords stealer
Steals telegram session(without any notifications) and google chrome credentials. Sending via telegram bot.
Definitely works in 2020 with Chrome Version 86.0.4240.75 (Official Build)(the newest on the uploading date: 12.10.2020) and Telegram version 2.4.3.0.

How to use:

1. Install telebot, pywin32, pycryptodome: pip install pytelegrambotapi pywin32 pycryptodome
2. Change telegram bot token and user_id variables to yours.
3. Build an exe with pyinstaller or other tool (better in venv to not include useless modules).

How to use telegram session files:

1. Download the same version of official "Telegram Desktop Portable" as you get in your bot in captions of the file or try on the newest if you're lucky one (the stealer works only if versions of your received files are the same as your Telegram client).
2. Run "Telegram.exe" 1 time until "tdata" folder appears.
3. Unzip your "tdata.zip" and find in there "tdata" folder.
4. Replace "tdata" folder in your Telegram Portable folder and all the files with your stealed folder "tdata" and files.
5. Go back and run "Telegram.exe".
